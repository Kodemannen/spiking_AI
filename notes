Plan:
	- Want to illustrate using very few pixels
		- Will make a car game with two lanes 
		- can go up or down, must dodge obstacles ('pixels') that come one at a time in a 
		  random lane

		- Since pygame has a minimum screen size, we will emulate pixels
		- Create grid structure in game 

	- The input neurons in the SNN sees one square each	
		- One spike when the obstacle is in the square
	
	- Need to find a parameter setting that has slow activity


CURRENT:

    - Restructure using objects
        - player + each obstacle should be GameObject instances


    - Implement food 
        - this will make it possible to see the network having to 
          make a decision, not just simply move away from everything
